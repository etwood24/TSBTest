# TSBTest

This project uses Dotnet to test the Sandbox TradeMe website.

To run:
1. Firstly create a user account with the below credentials:
etwood@gmail.com / TSBTestingEvan123!
2. In order to work with the Captcha, the application should be run in debug mode with a breakpoint enabled at every line that calls the LoginPage.LogIn() method. Once the application is paused, manually verify the Captcha in the browser.
